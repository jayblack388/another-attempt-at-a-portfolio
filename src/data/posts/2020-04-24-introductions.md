## Hello World

Hello there, my name is John Blackwell and I'm a relatively new Software Engineer ðŸš€! I decided that in 2020 I was going to start writing regularly and this will be the first of hopefully many articles to come. I mainly plan to write about software development topics, but could see some other topics getting covered (maybe traveling, books/comics, movies, we'll se where this ends up going).
